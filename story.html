      <p class="placeholder" data-t="content">
        Tears well up in my eyes. It hurts, why. Everyone's laughing at me. I
        can feel them staring at me. I was wearing my mothers gown. At school.
        How did this happen? The entire school was there, in the hall, in the
        hall, and I was there, embarrassed. Scorned. But I was just dreaming.
        The cicadas cry in the summer. Incessantly. I was dreaming. Again. I
        haven’t been to school in a while. It was summer though, a particularly
        hot one. I left my window open overnight. There was a fly buzzing around
        my ear. More than one. June is a long month for me, but at least I can
        stay home. My father passed away in June. It'll be about a year from
        tomorrow. The latchkey kids are playing out in the street, I can hear
        them. They laugh incessantly. I get out of bed. It's routine for me. I
        don’t usually get out of bed. Only when I can no longer stand the taste
        of my own breath. But this morning was different. I hear Mom on the
        phone downstairs. I get curious about my mother’s calls. She’s very
        private, but from what I’ve understood, she talks to many men, each time
        with a different name. She’s been shopping a lot more recently, so I
        assume it pays. Her new sweaters are colorful, a little too colorful for
        me. And the prints.. “What did I tell you about leering in on my phone
        calls!” She’s caught me again. “Don’t give me that fuckin look, its
        creepy. You’re a creep, just like your father!” I often contort my face,
        I can’t really help it, it just goes that way. My mother didn’t much
        care for me, as is why I haven’t been to school in months. But I guess
        that’s the status quo these days. Parents don’t worry too much about
        who, where, or what their children are up to. I removed myself from the
        hall, away from the landline to give my mother the privacy she desired.
        I feel hungry today. We don’t keep much food in the house. My mother’s
        always eating out. On dates at those flashy late-night lounges. She
        didn’t feel a need. I'm a few years out from being an adult now. Old
        enough to no longer require my mother’s cooking, even though that was
        always few and far between. I’ll go for a walk. It’s hot out. Like I
        said. It’s June. I have my cassette player with me. I hate a lot of
        things, I’ve learned to hate a lot of things. Not by choice, but as a
        necessity. Hate was good. Hate was normal. My mother hated my father, my
        father hated me. So you would think because my mother hated my father
        and my father hated me, the one who bore the most hatred from the man
        she hated above all would get some relief. But this was not the case.
        She hated me just as much as she hated that man. I was given his face.
        His vulgar, disfigured face. I love music. I’m particularly into a lot
        of the current hot New Wave bands. Duran Duran, The Cure, Talking heads.
        Springsteen was a genius, Madonna was for fags. I appreciated Madonna,
        although I wasn’t a fag. Apart from my father’s dashing good looks, I
        inherited his love for women. My father loved women. He loved them a
        little too much. I don’t blame my mother for hating him. I can say this;
        he died <em>doing</em> what he loved. As I walk through the
        neighborhood, towards town, I pass by a park. I see a girl there,
        sitting on a swing. She’s surrounded by three other girls. I can’t make
        out what they're saying, but it’s a familiar scene. I know those three
        girls. Not that I know them personally, but I know the type. My mother
        is away from home quite often. Often enough, and long enough, for me to
        enjoy myself when I know no one's watching. It’s a nightly ritual. Those
        three girls standing there. Those girls. The type of girls that often
        frequent my imagination during my nighttime activities. The type of
        girls who would surround her on the swing, full intimidation, perfect
        formation. I'm sure they aren't friends. I stop and watch. From afar.
        “Hey! I just love your blouse…” “Yeah! Yeah! I like your leggings too!
        So colorful! They're just perfect, you must tell me where you got them!”
        “You guys are so funny… why would you ever want to dress like a dyke,
        she looks hilarious!” “Hahaha we're just kidding, I could never. What a
        queer… and look at that blank stare on her face, it's so hideous!” The
        girls continue with their insults, I watch the proceedings from a safe
        distance, interested in the direction things are going. They begin to
        grab her shirt, lifting it up, exposing her. One of the girls pulls out
        a small pocket knife, the other two hold her arms up. It’s interesting.
        She doesn’t seem to react. She’s like a corpse. Her face hardly changes.
        The girl with the knife begins carving into her stomach. The other two
        laugh. I catch a glimpse of her face, no reaction. It’s impressive. I
        couldn’t say that I would be able to stay as stone cold as she was. The
        girls finish their engraving, the marking barely legible from my line of
        sight. Seemingly satisfied, the three begin to walk off, smirking and
        cackling amongst each other, putting out their cigarettes all over her
        before they disappear out of view. Like I said before, it’s interesting.
        Out of curiosity–and bordem–I walk over. She’s laying face up at this
        point, still wearing the same blank stare she had on during the previous
        encounter. I stand overtop of her, the word “dyke” clearly visible to me
        now. I don’t say anything, I am just interested in her face. It’s
        unnerving, unmoving, unbreakable. It’s beautiful. As the blood drips
        down her stomach, seeping into the dirt, she remains still. I follow her
        eyes. They're looking up. Not at the sky, not at the clouds, not at the
        birds, not at the rays of sunlight. Something higher, much further than
        I could see. Outstanding. “What’s your name?” I ask. “It’s dyke” “What’s
        your name?” I ask, ignoring her first response. “Like I said before,
        it’s dyke” “I was watching you before. You never told those girls your
        name, and I don't think they knew you. So how did they know what name to
        carve into your stomach?” I act smart. “Lucky guess.” She’s annoying me,
        but she looks beautiful. Her gaze that is. That blank look. I get
        curious again. I want to see what other faces she might make. I grab a
        clump of dirt, her blood has fully seeped into it now. In my hand,
        balled into a fist, I shove the dirt directly into her open wound,
        making sure to spread it across her entire stomach. She leaps up,
        howling in pain. I see a new expression, I see her teeth as she screams.
        It’s simply beautiful, I've never seen anything like it. As I am
        entranced by her mouth, now wide open, I fail to respond when she sinks
        her teeth directly into my shoulder. An act of retaliation. Through my
        shirt, her teeth pierce my skin. I’m met with a sharp pain–a new
        sensation. I cry out, fall to the ground. She’s on top of me now, the
        blood and dirt from her stomach dripping onto me. She’s latched onto my
        collarbone, her teeth are deep into my shoulder. I feel a burning pain
        throughout my body. I am unable to move. Time passes, maybe a few
        minutes? Lost in this new feeling, I come to my senses. “Ouch! Get the
        fuck off me you crazy bitch!” I shove her to the ground. I get up and
        collect my bearings, but she's a fighter. I feel a similar
        sensation–this time, on my left calf muscle. She’s bit me again. I fall
        on my rear. But I fight back. I scratch at her stomach, each slash I can
        feel her engraving opening wider, the warmth of her blood underneath my
        fingernails. This goes on for a while. I start to get lightheaded, her
        movements match mine. We fall to the ground. Lying in the dirt. More
        time passes. I wake up to the blistering sun, and a burning body. She’s
        bit me. She’s scratched me. I’m bleeding, but it doesn’t really hurt.
        She’s still unconscious, laying face up in a similar fashion as before.
        This time, I lay down next to her. I try to mimic the blank expression
        she wore when I first walked over, but I have no one to confirm its
        accuracy. She wakes up after a while of me sunbathing. She doesn’t move,
        but I hear her breathing shift. I glance over. This is the first time I
        get a closer look at her. She has messy red curly hair, a crooked face,
        freckles, a hooked jew nose, and big bushy eyebrows. Frankly she’s
        hideous. But she’s beautiful. The most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
        As I lay there, beside myself, I remember something. Something I almost
        forgot. Something that felt so distant, a feeling from a lifetime ago. I
        was hungry. I hadn’t eaten. I turned to her again. “Come into town with
        me, I am going to get something to eat” She doesn't react, which doesn’t
        surprise me. I omit any sort of follow up. I stand, grab my cassette,
        now covered in dirt, and walk back in the direction I was heading. As I
        make it a few steps away, I hear her shuffling behind me. I turn and see
        her standing, inching towards me. I wait for her to catch up. We walk in
        stride, in silence. I'm an awkward guy, I'm many things. A melomaniac, a
        ciniphile, a racist, a masochist, a sadist, a homophobe, an artist, a
        poet, a pervert. But above all else, I’m awkward. As we walk together,
        nearly hand in hand, I am overwhelmed with this feeling of awkwardness.
        As any awkward guy would do, I scramble for something to fill this
        silence. As my eyes dart around, I remember what I have with me, and who
        I am. “So you must like music right… Who are your favorite bands? What
        album are you currently listening to? Right now I'm really int-” “No, I
        don't listen to music” She replies curtly. “What about movies? Do you
        have any favorite movies?” “No, not particularly” “Well… what about
        books? Im sure you've read Ludlum-” “No” Fuck. This girl was impossible
        to talk to. But I couldn't help it. She was frumpy, plain, gaudy, but
        the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in the entire world. I forfeit
        any other attempts at conversation. We continue our walk, passing by a
        school, a church, a grocer, gas stations, benches, and vagrants. We
        reach a corner, there's a hotdog stand. A small line, not too long of a
        wait. I half guide us over there, stepping in the back of the line. As I
        stand in line with her, I am able to closely examine her legs. There are
        several scars running up and down the inside of her thighs. She’s
        wearing very small shorts, I can see the hairs on her legs, unshaved.
        I'm getting excited, but the large paper mache hotdog atop the hotdog
        stand brings me back to reality. As we get to the front, I order us two
        hotdogs. Extra mustard, no ketchup. I pay with the coins I brought with
        me from home. We sat down at the nearby picnic bench. To my surprise,
        she sits next to me, as opposed to across. “Do you like hotdogs? I think
        they’re great in the sum–” “No, I don’t eat meat” She says in a deadpan
        tone. By this point, I'm not surprised. I choke down both of the
        hotdogs. She remains next to me. I can feel her glancing at me every so
        often. I get nervous. I'm shy, and awkward. I've never actually sat down
        and ate with a girl before. It’s new, it’s exciting. All of my previous
        attempts at starting a conversation were in vain. But I get an idea.
        Something pops up into my head. A thought that only a twisted pervert
        like me could concoct. A disgrace. “I get real horny when I bleed… Do
        you?” There. I went and did it. Any other circumstance would've been a
        no-go, but given that we were walking around in public, shirts covered
        in blood with open wounds all over, I figured I'd better give it a shot.
        Nothing else worked, so why the hell not? “Yeah” Finally, a response
        that didn't begin with the word “No”. I was happy. This was progress.
        Little by little. I was getting excited again. I could barely contain
        myself. I was foolish to ever think I could replicate her stone cold
        poker face for even a second. My mother tells me all the time how
        hideous my face is. It contorts to every emotion I feel. What can I say?
        I can’t really help it. She can totally see exactly how excited I am
        right now. I was right. I see her eyes locked on to me. She’s looking at
        me– directly. I think for the first time since I met her. She doesn’t
        take her eyes off me. It’s been a while. It’s intense. I don't know how
        much longer I can take it. I'm going to finish… Right before I finish
        that thought, she moves her face closer. The motion of her face being
        brought closer to mine replays in my head. All while it's happening in
        real time. It plays over, and over. Slow, fast, on repeat, fast, slow. I
        feel my face getting hot. Her face is almost touching mine. I
        instinctively close my eyes– I don't know why, I've never been in this
        position before. As my eyes are closed, my lips move on their own. I'm
        sure I look like a spaz. As I prepare for the first kiss of my life, it
        feels harder than I expect. Instead of the embrace of some soft, wet
        lips, I feel abrasive enamel. My lips are pinched together, a sharp pain
        overtakes my lower face, and it doesn't stop. She’s biting my mouth.
        She’s biting my mouth, and she's not letting up. It hurts. It hurts it
        hurts it hurts. It hurts so good. If I said before that I was going to
        finish something, well I was in the middle of finishing it now. It’s
        possible 5 more minutes go by, or maybe 5 years, maybe 5 millennia. I
        have no idea. Time passes. And my underwear is now soggy. She lets up.
        And looks at me again. This time, her gaze looks different. It looks as
        though she’s now looking down at a cockroach in her bedroom. One that
        she has just squashed, and is watching writhe in pain before it loses
        all oxygen. I burst out of my seat, my face beet red. I am overcome with
        embarrassment. I need to get out of here now. Before I make my grand
        escape, I mumble something to her. “Come again, by the swings. Maybe
        tomorrow. Please?” I turn and run home before I can look at her face,
        before I can confirm her reply. I sprint home, fast. I'm excited. I'm
        not a boy anymore, I'm a man. I'm in love. I'm a man in love. As I run
        home, I trip. I skin my leg, the same leg she dug her teeth into. It
        feels like an insult. This doesn’t feel nice. But it doesn’t matter.
        Nothing can ruin my mood. I'm on cloud nine. I'm elated. I'm elated. I'm
        a man. I made it. I want to tell my mom, mother. I want to tell her
        everything, I want her to know she’s wrong. I'm loved.
        <em
          >I'm leaving. I don’t know when I'll be back. You're old enough now, I
          don't need to be wasting my time hovering around you anymore – Mom</em
        >. It’s too late. As I arrive at home, I read a note left stuck to the
        fridge. Mom’s left. My mother, the great woman she was. Gone. It appears
        she's jet off to Monaco, Italy, Greece, Thailand, or any one of the
        other prostitute wastelands. To live with one of her so-called
        benefactors, husband, sugar daddy, lover. I don't care what she calls
        them. They're pimps. Pimping her out for money. That's it. Money. A
        waste, useless, horrid, disgusting money. Far more degenerate than
        anything I could ever do. And she's nothing to them. Nothing but their
        whore. One whore of many whores. One whore, two whore, red whore, blue
        whore. One-hundred whores, One-thousand whores. Whores galore. It's
        disgusting, and I want nothing to do with it. I'm glad. I'm glad she's
        gone. She never cared for me anyway. And I don't need her anymore. I'm
        loved. There's a girl that cares about me. Someone out there that is
        willing to hurt me. Hurt me because she loves me. That night I had the
        best sleep of my life. I dreamt of her, bathing in blood. I'm no longer
        in school. I'm no longer in my mother’s gown. Nobody’s laughing, I'm not
        scorned. I'm loved. I'm enveloped in a red bath of our blood. It’s warm.
        So warm. I never want to leave. I woke up the next morning. I've
        ejaculated in my pants. It’s warm. I'm warm. The sun is shining down on
        me. Its rays tickle me. I'm warm. The latchkey kids are playing outside.
        Their usual antics. Their screams and laughs massage my ears. I'm warm.
        I skipped breakfast this morning. I'm not hungry. Instead get dressed.
        Laundry is done. Perfect. Mom washed the whites before she left. I put
        on my brightest white t-shirt. I'm excited for the shade of red it will
        be when I return this evening. It's about noon now. I step outside. The
        blistering sun soothes me. It’s nice. It’s warm. I see her again. She’s
        laying face up, like last time. It seems the girls have paid her a visit
        again. Fresh marks, this time all over her arms and legs. Perfect. More
        places for me to violate. We fight. We dance. We touch. It hurts. And it
        hurts all over. I feel as though we become one. My body eventually grows
        numb from the pain. It burns everywhere. I feel like I'm on fire. I can
        barely breathe. Her marks stretch every inch of my body. With every new
        mark, the deeper into my flesh she dives. Perfect. My days go on.
        Everyday, a new wound. With each day. More blood is spilled. I've lost
        weight. Maybe I've skipped breakfast one too many mornings, maybe I've
        lost too much blood. I don't care. It’s fall now. The leaves on the
        ground offer too much cushioning for our daily activities. It makes it
        soft, gentle. I don't like it. I can't wait for winter. It's January
        now. I think a new year? Maybe 1987 now? I can't be sure. We've met
        every day without fail. I guess this is what it means to be in a long
        term relationship. I love it. The colder days make for an even more
        pleasurable experience. I'm sure she feels the same. We haven't said a
        word to each other since the first day we met. We don't need to. That's
        not how we communicate. I've lost a considerable amount of weight now. I
        can tell. I don't often look at myself in the mirror, but on the rare
        occasion I do, it's always a surprise. I can feel my body getting
        weaker, but it's better that way. It makes the pain more potent. I'm
        sure she feels the same. It's February now. The days are freezing. But
        we don't dress for the cold. Only a tshirt. A tshirt as proof of the
        blood we exchange. Our flesh needs to be as close together as it can be.
        This is how we've always done things. Today’s a particularly cold day.
        But even so, I feel so warm. She makes me feel so warm. This is what
        love is supposed to feel like. It's supposed to hurt. Today she's going
        easy on me, her bites don't burn and her scratches don't cut as deep. Is
        she getting weaker? It’s annoying. Is this our first fight as a couple?
        I push her harder, I squeeze her harder, as a way to encourage her to
        turn up the heat a little bit. I think this will work… It always has.
        It's not working. Instead she's loosening up her grip even more. It's
        like she's not even trying. She's gone limp. Now I'm getting really
        annoyed. She's completely stopped trying. I'm forced to let go and look
        at her now. Look at her face close up again, so I can see what the deal
        is. She's lying face down in the snow this time, that's unusual. Oh
        wait. She's dead. It’s beautiful.
