        A story about a cat and a man who lost his woman, so why should he go to
        church?
      </h2>
      <p data-t="content">
        He was a quick-witted guy, or wait, was he a cat? I can't remember. He
        walked into the bar, the one right on the corner of Crosby and Spring
        St. Or was it a cafe? bistro? Again, I can't remember. His claws were
        sharp, just like his mind. I liked his coat, I admired it. He sat down
        at the stool furthest from the door. Furthest from me. You know, I like
        sitting closest to the door. A quick escape, just incase things go
        south. I was quite the troublemaker after all. I mean trouble liked to
        follow me, or I guess I could find it pretty easily. Whatever. He orders
        his usual. Jack on the rocks. Classic. It was 2:30 on a Sunday
        afternoon. He turns towards me. I avoid his gaze. He's sharp remember, I
        don't like making eye contact with those types. He could probably read
        me with a quick glance. I don't like it one bit. Yuck. I had a hundred
        dollars in my pocket. Every last cent for her. She never showed up, and
        I went home frustrated. As usual. The cat left soon after me, He never
        finished his drink, his coat drapped against the dirty sidewalk, that
        bothers me. I skipped church, evening service. What's even the point?
        She never showed, so why should I repent my sins? All I did today was
        drink, sounds pretty holy to me. I spend my night watching cable, I like
        it when the news comes on. The lady anchor reminds me of her, boy is she
        a looker. But it's not enough. I go to sleep. Frustrated. Im sure that
        cat slept like a fucking baby. Wait, I should say a kitten. Haha.
