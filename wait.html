      It's Valentine's Day. <br /><br />I stare down the bottom of an empty pint glass. <br />There's two of them, side by side. <br />I drank two, <br />I'll drink another. <br />Maybe some more. <br />They're next to each other. <br />It's like I'm looking down the barrel of a shotgun, <br />I wish. <br />They're next to each other, <br />There's foam. <br />It's drying up. <br />It's a great day. <br />Because we are in love. <br />I'm here, <br />and I have a gun. <br />Just kidding. <br />It's Valentine's Day. <br />But I wake up, <br />with a cup... that you made. <br />And I have you, <br />we are together. <br />I wish. <br />We aren't next to each other, but we are. <br />Today's a great day. <br />Because we are in love. <br />Want to see what I <a href="home.html" class="continue-link">made?</a> <br />
