      This is a site created for my love on our first Valentine's Day as a
      couple. We cannot be together. She is very far away. I still have many
      things I want to give her. Do for her. Say to her. I can express myself in
      the only ways I know how. I don't have much in life, even though I've been
      given everything. But I have her, and that is what matters. When you have
      something like that. Special, you do what you can not to let go of it. I
      will continue to devote myself to her. Give, give give give.
    </p>
    <p class="bigwhite" data-t="intro2">
      I've collected some things here. Things I've worked on. For you. About
      you, us. Some music, writing, pictures, drawings. Everything I care about.
      I think is cool. I had to show you. Doing things like this is fun. It
      makes me feel like everything I've ever learned mattered. It mattered
      because I was able to show it to you one day. I was able to express myself
      in a way that felt genuine. That someone would appreciate the things I
      liked. Took the time to learn about me and enjoy what I had to show. Who I
      am.
    </p>
    <p class="bigwhite" data-t="intro3">
      What a woman she is. She's brought into me a warm light. Warm. So warm. I
      can't be cold. I can't remember what it feels like. I have her. She makes
      me forget. I was so cold. She saw me. She's throwin herself into my life.
      My cold, crude, disgusting, and small life. So bright, beautiful, capable,
      talented, brilliant, special. Golden hair soft to the touch, a perfect
      smile, slender frame, tender eyes, safe, inviting, welcoming, home. She
      asks me about my dreams, she tells me that I can do it. I can do it, I
      can. She tells me I can reach what it is I dream of. My end goal. The
      pinnacle of my life. If everything in the world were to work out as we
      intended. What we seek, what makes us whole. What makes us real. Feel
      human. Alive. Happy, sad, angry, jealous, hurt. What makes us comfortable,
      what makes us laugh, cry, retreat. To brave, to hide, to speak. Learn,
      understand, grow, endure and everything else that ever existed. Well, I
      dream of her.
    </p>

      This site doesn't really make sense. It can come across as many things.
      But it's me, and it's for you. It's one form of expression of my many
      forms of expression. It's my most vulnerable and expressive self, all laid
      out for the sole sake of sharing myself with the one I love, which is you
      Priya. I hope you find it interesting, enjoyable, special, visceral, and
      cool.
