        Some important writings. I don't think they're all on paper. Here I will
        immortalize them, for you to read whenever you want, and think about the
        days before we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I was just a guy, with a
        big crush.

        February 5, 2026 <br />
        I wrote this for you on my way to Belgium, along with some roses. They
        withered a little, but made it all the way. I wrote this to you, as my
        valentine, my only valentine. Forever and ever. <br />
        <br />
        Dead roses are beautiful. That’s what I think. They’re gorgeous.
        Perfect. I’ve never seen a more beautiful flower. The first time I saw a
        rose I thought meh, what’s so great about them? But then it died, and it
        was such a beautiful shade. Dull, but full. Strong. Striking. Beautiful.
        Just beautiful. I saw you. I’ve never seen a more beautiful woman. Nope,
        never. Not even. I met you. I kissed you. I fell in love with you. And
        now I’ve been granted a girlfriend who’s the first and only angel to
        walk on this earth. And guess what? Now you’re my Valentine. I feel as
        though God is rewarding me for everything good I’ve ever done. But no
        reward could come close to the chance encounter of a lifetime that was
        meeting you. You’re beyond words Priya. Priya Priya Priya Priya Priya,
        Priya. That’s such a beautiful name. A name so out of this world even my
        awful obnoxious endless child-like imagination could never conceive it.
        If you told me I would meet a woman named Priya and she’d take my hand,
        kiss me, talk to me, love me, want me, adore me. Well, I just don’t
        believe that. That kind of thing only happens in movies. Maybe my life’s
        a movie. Maybe you’re the director. I’m just your actor. I do as you
        say, you give me my lines, you give me direction, I’m your star. Or
        maybe you’re my star, and I’m the one capturing every move you make. On
        camera, filtered through my eyes. I’d get all your good angels. You’d be
        an overnight sensation. That’s a movie I’d go see. See a million times.
        It’d be my favorite. We’re together, we’re in Belgium, we were just in
        London, we’re laughing, we’re smiling, we’re in love. Tomorrow we’ll be
        in love. Yesterday we were in love. I’m in love with you Priya. You know
        this, I know this. I want you to know that I’m in love with you. You’re
        perfect. You’re more beautiful than a dead rose. They’re boring. They’re
        dull, they’re bleak they’re dead. Dead dead, dead dead. What’s so good
        about being dead. I’ve never been captivated by anything the way I am by
        you. Your figure enchants me, your eyes reel me in. I’m stuck, I can’t
        get out. I don’t want to get out. I don’t want to be released from your
        wire. Your spell. Don’t throw me back in the water. I want to know this
        warmth forever. Your warmth. I need a lifetime with you, and then
        another one. Dead roses are beautiful, but they’re ugly. I’ve been ugly,
        but you make me beautiful. You’re beautiful, you’re smart-you’re a
        genius. Teach me everything you’ve ever learned in your beautiful life.
        And I’ll keep giving you flowers. Roses, lily’s, tulips, lotus, whatever
        you want. I’ll give you anything you want. I’m yours forever. Happy
        Valentine’s Day Priya.

        I wrote these down as well. Some things that I think we would enjoy
        together. I will cook them for you, maybe teach you how to cook them as
        well, but first I have to learn. There is no receipe I have in mind yet,
        but let's have this list be a note of what we want to make first.

        - Properly emulsify buttered noodles <br />
