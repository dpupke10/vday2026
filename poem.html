      <h2 data-t="title">You make me a better man, a positive one.</h2>
      <p data-t="content">
        I'm sad, <br />
        but for you, I couldn't be happier. <br />
        For you, I am the most radiant man anyone I've met has ever known.
        <br />
        I become positive, I woke up on the right side of the bed today. <br />
        Same as yesterday, same as tomorrow. <br />
        As I walk to the grocery, a man stops me. <br />
        He asks for change, I give him everything I have. <br />
        Even my groceries. <br />
        Why? <br />
        Because for me, she gave me everything. <br />
        My ability to come up with words to describe her, <br />
        Is never ending. <br />
        It's everything. <br />
        <br />
        Her music, <br />
        poetry, <br />
        art, <br />
        voice, <br />
        her notes of affirmation, <br />
        her signs of affection, <br />
        her words of encouragement, <br />
        her belief in me, <br />
        her trust in me, <br />
        her love for me, <br />
        it's all I... <br />
        could've ever asked for. <br />
        <br />
        And then some.
        <br />
        <br />
        And then some more, and more, and more. <br />
        Seconds, third, fourths. <br />
        Whatever numbers come after. <br />
        I can't remember my numbers when I'm around her. <br />
        My math is wrong. <br />
        my literature is boring, <br />
        my brain is mush, <br />
        my poetry sucks. <br />
        <br />
        It's because with her I have nothing to prove. <br />
        I don't need to pretend to be violent. <br />
        A pretentious person who thinks, <br />
        everything is better when it's worse. <br />
        I don't need it. <br />
        <br />
        I don't.
        <br />
        I like it this way. <br />
        I don't need anything else. <br />
        The world looks better when it revolves around her. <br />
        I want to do more for others <br />
        So maybe, <br />
        others do more for her. <br />
        All I ask... <br />
        <br />
        is for her to talk to me. <br />
        <br />
        And, <br />
        <br />
        like me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Really like me.
